## Contributing

1. Clone the Repository: Before you start contributing, clone the repository to your local development environment: 

```BASH 
git clone <Repository_URL>
```

2. Create a New Branch: From the `dev` branch, create a new branch with a descriptive name for the feature or fix you're going to implement. This ensures that each task has its own separate branch:


```BASH
git checkout dev
git checkout -b feature-name
```
3. Feature Development: Work on your branch to develop the feature or fix. Ensure you make regular and descriptive commits to keep a record of changes:

```BASH
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Change Description"
```
4. Keep Your Branch Updated: Before finalizing your work, sync your branch with the `dev` branch to ensure it's up-to-date. This reduces the chance of conflicts:

``` BASH
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout feature-name
git merge dev
```
5. Resolve Conflicts (if necessary): If there are conflicts during the merge, resolve them appropriately and continue with development.

6. Testing and Verification: Ensure your code works correctly and passes all necessary tests.

7. Create a Pull Request: Once the feature is complete and all tests have passed, create a Pull Request (PR) from your branch to the 'dev' branch. Provide a detailed description of the change and any relevant information.

8. Pull Request Review: Team members will review your PR, conduct additional testing if necessary, and provide feedback.

9. Address Comments: If there are comments or suggestions in the PR, address those suggestions and make changes to your branch as needed.

10. Merge the Pull Request: Once the PR has been reviewed and approved by repository contributors, it will be merged into the `dev` branch.

11. Delete the Branch: After the PR has been successfully merged, you can delete the feature branch if it's no longer needed:

```BASH
git branch -d feature-name
```

*Remember to follow these rules and best practices for effective contribution and to maintain an organized development flow in the repository.*
